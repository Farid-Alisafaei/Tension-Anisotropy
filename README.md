# Tension-Anisotropy
Tension anisotropy drives phenotypic transitions of cells via two-way cell-ECM feedback

Running the simulations using the three-dimensional cytoskeletal model

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following software installed and linked:

- Abaqus
- Visual Studio
- Intel Parallel Studio XE
(Instructions to find and download the compatible versions of Visual Studio and Intel Fortran and properly link Abaqus with Fortran can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_8CjAqcQNI)

Instructions:

1. Download and extract the Codes folder: After downloading the Codes folder, extract its contents to a directory of your choice.

2. Open Windows command prompt: Open the Windows command prompt by either opening the Start menu and searching for "cmd" or pressing the Windows key + R, typing "cmd" or "cmd.exe" in the Run command box, and pressing Enter.

3. Navigate to the simulation folder: Use the command prompt to navigate to the drive and the path where you extracted the Codes folder. For example:

C:
cd path\to\the\simulation\folder

4. Run Abaqus simulation: Execute either the "iso_34kpa.inp" (for circular substrate) or "aniso_34kpa.inp" (for rectangular substrate) from the command prompt:

abaqus job=iso_34kpa user=CellMatrixModel_11072018

Please note that the file "CellMatrixModel_11072018.for" contains a user subroutine UMAT code, which is based on the theoretical model for defining cytoskeletal material properties. Each section of the UMAT code is explained with annotations for clarity and ease of understanding.

5. Verify simulation completion: Check the last line in the "iso_34kpa.log" file to ensure the Abaqus job "iso_34kpa" is completed.

6. Open simulation results in Abaqus: Open the "iso_34kpa.odb" (or aniso_34kpa.odb) file generated by the simulation.

7. Adjust visualization settings to plot the cell contractility:
- From the Results Tree on the left, navigate to Output Databases > iso_34kpa.odb > Instances
- Right-click on the CYTOSKELETONPART-1 and pick Replace
- From the Menu bar, navigate to Plots > Contours > On Deformed shape
- Navigate to Results > Field Output > Primary Variable > SDV48 > OK
- Ensure the deformation scale factor is uniform and set to 1 (From Options > Common > Basic > Deformation Scale Factor).
- Enable the translucency to have the contractility plot within the cytoskeleton (From Options > Common > Other > Translucency)

Files Included:

- iso_34kpa.inp: Abaqus input file for the circular substrate.
- aniso_34kpa.inp: Abaqus input file for the rectangular substrate.
- CellMatrixModel_11072018.for: User subroutine UMAT code based on the theoretical model to define cytoskeletal material properties.
